23124,So that night I went home /,

23126,"and she said , "" Baby , I really want you to go to college . /",
23127,It 's always been my dream that my children all go to school . /,
23128,But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you 're going to have to have to go to school /,

23130,"At that time my dad was in prison at the time , /",

23137,"Yes , my brother went to school . /",

23151,I was really afraid . /,
23152,"But he told me to go ahead and try it , /",

23164,"At first I did n't want to apply for it , /",
23165,"but the principal called me during the summer months and said , "" Sandra the time is running out , /",

23184,and as I started I think I was taking economics . /,taking_office
23185,I think that was the last class I took . /,
23186,My husband became very ill with cancer /,complication

23190,"Yeah , /",

23233,oh all righty /,
23234,i think we know what we 're going to speak about /,public_speaking
23235,um tell you what /,
23236,i 'll start off /,taking_office
23237,how 's that /,
23238,okay you go ahead /,
23239,there is one state that does that by the way /,
23240,what is that /,
23241,i want to say Oklahoma /,
23242,i saw report something the other night about it /,reporting
23243,they do n't do them real often which is obviously the death penalty /,
23244,um but i think if we quit uh building these Taj Mahals with the color TVs and <disfluency> sixty dollars </disfluency> sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there <disfluency> on a on a </disfluency> on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with /,resignation:house-building:taking_office
23245,and let 's just screwing up the system uh /,
23246,well the sentences are so unbelievable /,
23247,i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before he 's paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months /,sentence:murder:parole:rape
23248,that 's pathetic /,
23249,it 's -,
23250,because they just say there 's either no room in the system you know in the jails for them /,
23251,or you know it 's just that it seems like the automatic sentences <disfluency> if </disfluency> if a judge has leeway on what he 's going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and uh fifty years and you know what 's his whim to decide it should be two months /,sentence
23252,this is true /,
23253,so what /,
23254,you know let 's quit BSing with the system /,resignation
23255,well even if it 's life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life /,
23256,we could spend that money you know for starving children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that /,hunger:hunger
23257,so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt <disfluency> they should </disfluency> that should be it you know particularly for some of these really -,
23258,a life for a life /,
23259,i mean there are so many just major major serial murders /,murder
23260,and it 's not just like one instance or something /,
23261,it 's just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on /,haunting
23262,the old Charles Manson case /,
23263,i mean the guy <disfluency> is really </disfluency> -- <TURN> yeah / and the - yeah / there 's just - everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um - <TURN> -- just should n't be allowed <disfluency> to </disfluency> to <disfluency> even </disfluency> even live /,
23264,for example there 's a hung jury here in Fort Worth /,
23265,two day in eight to four /,
23266,and bam bam the guy got off /,
23267,uh <disfluency> he was </disfluency> uh <disfluency> he </disfluency> he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son /,killing
23268,yeah i heard about that on the news /,
23269,um kind of gets back to the second request we 've been asked to look at /,
23270,is most criminal cases requiring an ananimous verdict /,
23271,<disfluency> the </disfluency> a situation like that i 'd say no let 's just go like a regular vote /,disinvestment
23272,eight to four tells me that <disfluency> there were eight </disfluency> there 's a <disfluency> percentage </disfluency> certain percentage of the people there with <disfluency> sixty percent of the people </disfluency> uh seventy percent of the people said hey -,
23273,rather than have to retrial the <disfluency> whole </disfluency> whole thing and spend all the money for people to you know go back to court and all the lawyers /,
23274,and i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers <disfluency> a fortune </disfluency> you know a fortune to keep doing that /,
23275,the guy 's guilty /,
23276,and the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution /,workaround:drag
23277,because it 's not next day they have <disfluency> the start </disfluency> the trial which is X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more /,
23278,i think <disfluency> that </disfluency> that <disfluency> if it 's </disfluency> if it 's not a split decision uh go with the highest number and let 's just get on with the program /,
23279,uh but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there 's a jury because that 's what the juries are for is to make the decision /,casting_vote:referendum
23280,um what are your feelings /,
23281,well <disfluency> if i </disfluency> i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from Florida /,show
23282,and she just has just really stiff penalties /,
23283,and i saw that <disfluency> in </disfluency> in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved <disfluency> it could </disfluency> you could have <disfluency> a </disfluency> a judge that would really make a good impact /,sentence:custodial_sentence
23284,but likewise you could have the flip side and have some judge that was paid off or you know had <disfluency> good </disfluency> a good old boy network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through /,
23285,so <disfluency> he </disfluency> he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power you know if used wrongly /,use
23286,so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help <disfluency> it </disfluency> with it anyway /,humanitarian_activity:humanitarian_activity
23287,i do n't know if it prevents it /,contraception
23288,but seems like the jury system does have its advantages /,
23289,but <disfluency> i also </disfluency> i 've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know /,picking
23290,and i do n't know how much they 're getting just a jury of their peers at that point /,
23291,they 're really getting a select group /,
23292,it 's not just random people /,
23293,it almost should be the first twelve people that they you know <disfluency> that </disfluency> have on a list are the ones that are on the jury /,
23294,and that 's it /,
23295,i get back to Price 's comment when he uh was found guilty /,
23296,he said well he did n't have any blacks uh you know from his neck of the woods /,
23297,well give me a break you know /,
23298,you know /,
23299,he 'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he 's got his peers or something /,
23300,i mean <disfluency> you 're </disfluency> you 're in Dallas /,
23301,so everybody -,
23302,i ca n't believe they can uh -,
23303,like in a murder situations they look for juries who do n't know anything about the system well or know anything about <disfluency> the </disfluency> the occurrence /,

23327,IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA,
23328,"Case Number 4:04-CV-02688 TAMMY J. KITZMILLER , et al. , Plaintiffs vs. DOVER AREA SCHOOL DISTRICT ; DOVER AREA SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF DIRECTORS , Defendants",
23329,TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS OF BENCH TRIAL,
23330,"Before : HONORABLE JOHN E. JONES , III",
23331,"Date : September 28 ,",
23332,"Place : Courtroom Number 2 , 9th Floor Federal Building Walnut Street Harrisburg , Pennsylvania",

23335,For Plaintiffs : Julie Smith Christy Rehm Beth Eveland,
23336,-LRB- The following discussion occurred in chambers : -RRB-,
23337,Let 's go on the record .,
23338,"We are in chambers , and this is the matter of Kitzmiller , of course , versus Dover Area School District .",
23339,We have assembled as planned with respect to the issue of certain subpoenas that have been issued to reporters Joseph Maldonado and Heidi Bernhard-Bubb .,adhesive_bonding:adhesive_bonding
23340,"Present in chambers are counsel for both the plaintiffs and the defendants , and in addition to that , let me ask that you enter your appearances specially , presumably as counsel for the individuals we referred to in our orders collectively as "" reporters . """,entrance
23341,"I 'm here , Niles Benn , on behalf of both of the reporters , Heidi Bernard-Bubb and Joseph Maldonado .",
23342,"And with me is Terance Barna , an attorney in my office , as well .",
23343,"Now , previously , on September 12th , the Court entered an order which went to the motion for reconsideration . That related specifically to -- filed by the reporters .",entrance:retraction_notice:intimate_relationship:filing
23344,"That went specifically to our August 2nd order which , in effect , said that the reporters would have to testify at certain depositions .",testimony
23345,"Subsequently , the reporters were , if memory serves , approximately eight days ago , subpoenaed to testify by the plaintiffs in the case-in-chief .",subpoena:testimony
23346,Yet another motion to quash or for alternative relief was filed by the reporters through Mr. Benn 's office .,filing
23347,"By our order of last Thursday -- the date escapes me , I think it was Thursday -- the Court denied relief in that matter .",order:escape:denial
23348,"The Court was advised that yesterday , on September the 27th , the reporters , both of them , showed up at the appointed times for their depositions as appropriately scheduled by the defendants , and I 'm advised -- and I 'll correct this if I 'm wrong -- that both reporters cited the reporter 's privilege that they consider to exist under the First Amendment so that they would not answer any questions at those depositions .",advice:appointment:scheduling:advice:conventional_amendment:conventional_amendment
23349,"We 're brought here today by that , as well as the fact that I presume you 're here because the reporters have been properly subpoenaed to appear in the plaintiffs ' case-in-chief .",subpoena
23350,"Now , have I mischaracterized anything from your standpoint ?",
23351,"No , everything that you said is correct , Your Honor .",
23352,"Now , the most salient question then is , with respect to the reporters ' appearance today , is it your understanding that the reporters are intending to invoke the same privilege cited by them yesterday , if called , when called , to testify by the plaintiffs ?",testimony
23353,But that 's the reason why I had asked if we could have this conference .,
23354,The floor is yours .,
23355,I 'm not here to discuss law .,discussion
23356,"I think we have discussed the law ad nauseam with respect to briefs , argument .",discussion
23357,"I certainly understand the opinion and orders that have been rendered by the Court , and I appreciate them .",
23358,And I do n't want there to be a misunderstanding in terms as to this case being wrongly focused .,blooper
23359,"And what I mean by that , with regard to all of you in this room is that we 've got approximately 40 people from the media that are observing this trial in the courtroom , plus outside of the courtroom .",naturalistic_observation:stylistic_device
23360,"In speaking for myself , it would be my humble opinion that if these parties were called to the stand to testify and refuse to testify , as I just indicated to you , Your Honor , that I think the focus of this trial all of the sudden is n't addressed as to intelligent design , but rather the media is going to be very much concerned in terms as to these stringers , not full-time employees , not employees at all , standing up for what they think is right .",public_speaking:testimony:social_rejection:testimony:social_rejection
23361,And I really truly believe in my heart of hearts the focus gets misdirected .,
23362,"I really truly do mean that , because I do n't think that should be the focus of this case .",
23363,"As a result of that , Mr. Barna and I have spent days in an effort to try to see if there was a means by which we could somehow ameliorate the problem so that , in a certain sense , everybody gets what they want .",
23364,"I clearly will not get what I want , because at the end of the day , if I agree that my reporters are going to testify predicated upon something that I want to propose here , that 's more than I would want , because I stand by the fact and they stand by the fact that there 's a reporter 's privilege here .",dissolution:testimony:research_proposal
23365,"They refuse to testify at a deposition , and my suggestion to them was that if we were capable of resolving something as a result of this conference , that they would then attend a deposition , because I believe the defendants would have a right to cross-examine them or otherwise examine them prior to them taking the stand .",rejection:testimony:workaround:workaround:attendance:physical_examination
23366,"And based upon that , they would then testify in court .",testimony
23367,But we have several issues .,
23368,"One is that when we filed our motion to quash last week , quite honestly , we thought we did it in a timely fashion because we filed it only after we were served with the subpoena .",filing:filing:public_service:subpoena
23369,"Your Honor summarily dismissed that motion to quash , so , in effect , if my reporters were to be called upon to testify today by the plaintiffs , they 're undressed .",testimony
23370,They 've got no protective order at all .,
23371,They 're just regular people .,
23372,Because the order I believe that you had previously entered related to the deposition and not related to their appearance in court .,order:intimate_relationship:intimate_relationship
23373,So that raises an issue for us because clearly we would otherwise object to them taking the stand under the order as it currently exists or the motion that you 're -- your position that the motion to quash could not stand .,objection:objection
23374,"I interpret the order and the amended order to mean that Your Honor , in a sense , has addressed them as fact witnesses .",interpretation:amendment
23375,"I do n't think you actually come out and use the word "" fact witnesses , "" but as one reads the order , that 's the implication .",use:reading
23376,And you initially had indicated that you did not feel that the reporter 's privilege stood in this kind of a case .,standing
23377,These two newspapers respectively go to approximately 89 municipal meetings in terms of different municipalities and school districts .,go
23378,"And ironically -- in a sense , I have to commend both Mr. Maldonado and Ms. Bernard-Bubb because , again , they 're paid per story .",payment
23379,They get anywhere between $ 40 and $ 50 a story .,
23380,"They might make $ 300 , $ 400 a week if they write X number of stories , and that 's it .",writing_process
23381,And the stories that they write predominantly are municipal stories .,writing_style
23382,She 's a full-time mom .,
23383,She 's breastfeeding .,breastfeeding
23384,"She has a seven - month old child , and so she works at night when her husband is at home .",manual_work
23385,He 's a schoolteacher .,
23386,"Mr. Maldonado owns a little deli in the market in York , and he home-schools his son , his youngest son who has learning disabilities .",ownership
23387,And he 's been doing that for the last three years .,
23388,So this is just supplemental income to them because they 're not very wealthy people .,
23389,"But yet without a lot of education in terms of journalism , they believe that what they 're standing for is the right thing .",education
23390,"So having said that , their fear is that because of all those municipalities that they cover and the school districts that they cover , that at least in the Middle District Court , should a matter come up similar to this case , then they are exposed as a fact witness .",exposure
23391,"I 've related to them , quite frankly , this is the first case we 've ever had in federal court in the years that I 've been doing newspaper law , and most of our cases are in county courts , and so , you know , there 's a different issue there .",intimate_relationship
23392,"But having said that , the concern that I have is that there is a precedent being set in the counties that these people otherwise work .",manual_work
23393,So how do I make it better ?,
23394,"Well , we provided an affidavit , and that affidavit indicated that we , if called upon to testify , would validate the authenticity of the articles that were written .",amenity:testimony:validation:writing_style
23395,"We did that , in effect , to offer to both sides so that we would n't otherwise have to testify .",outreach:testimony
23396,"Accepted by the plaintiffs , not accepted by the defendants .",acceptance:acceptance
23397,Defendants wanted to have the right of cross-examination .,
23398,"And at the time when you wrote the original order and you used the words "" perceived , saw , and heard , "" we were concerned , as you well know , with the word "" perceived "" in terms as to what 's the thought process .",writing_style:use:perception:perception
23399,"And there was dialogue on the phone amongst all of us , and you made it very clear that you did not want any testimony that would otherwise relate to biases and prejudices .",dialogue:testimony:intimate_relationship
23400,"And , in fact , when you reviewed the notes of the reporters , you had also indicated that your review of Heidi Bubb 's notes and the e-mails clearly evidence that there was no bias in the writings , those writings .",review
23401,"The concern that we currently have is that the order reads , in effect , that they have to testify as fact witnesses , predicated upon my interpretation , as to what is otherwise unpublished material so that , for example -- just using this for example .",reading:testimony:interpretation:use
23402,That 's not my intention .,
23403,"No , no , but I --",
23404,"Well , that 's not my intention .",
23405,"And I wanted to let you go as far as you could , and I think I have to interject and I want to interject and I want to be clear , because I think it 's important that I do that .",go
23406,Let me address a couple points that you made .,
23407,"First of all , I understand and deeply respect the position that you 're in in this case .",adhesive_bonding
23408,"And by saying that the motion was untimely , it was not legally untimely , it was untimely in my view only in the sense that it came , as I said , on the eve of trial , when we knew that there was going to be an issue with respect to their testimony at trial .",come:testimony
23409,It was an attempt to bring this to a head .,attempt
23410,It was successful in that respect .,
23411,"It was not successful in solving the problem , but it was successful to bringing it to a head .",workaround
23412,"So to that extent , I succeeded , good , bad , or indifferent .",success
23413,"With respect to the point that you made as it relates to their testimony at trial , that is a very valid point .",intimate_relationship:testimony
23414,"However , I will tell you that the sense of my opinion as it related to their deposition testimony and as reconsidered and as honed in the reconsideration , was that it was meant to apply -- the general thrust of that , the protections , if you will , in that opinion were meant to apply in the same sense to their testimony at trial , if they chose to testify , and they would be protected in every way by the Court , and they would not be questioned in the broader sense .",intimate_relationship:technoscience:environmental_protection:technoscience:technoscience:testimony:environmental_protection
23415,"So it would not revert back to an unprotected realm , if you will , at the time of trial .",reversible_process
23416,"To be as clear as I can be , at issue in this case -- and I ca n't particularly be concerned about precedential value .",
23417,I understand your concern in that regard .,
23418,I have to try this case the best way that I know how .,stoned
23419,"The concern in this case , and it is a vital concern by all parties , is that we have , as you well know , to restate the obvious , we have newspaper articles within which there are quotes from individuals .",
23420,"Those quotes go , at least in one sense , to the purpose behind the policy that was enacted by the Dover School Board .",go:legislative_enactment
23421,"The simple issue here , because it is the Court 's understanding that these individuals have denied that they made these remarks , is from the plaintiffs ' standpoint how can they get something that is , in my view , on the purpose test , which clearly goes to the truth of the matter asserted , how do they get these newspaper articles into evidence ?",denial:test:go:assertion
23422,"Well , they ca n't , in my view , without the reporters testifying .",testimony
23423,"The defendants might say that even with the reporters testifying , they ca n't get them in .",testimony
23424,I think that 's their argument .,argument
23425,"But at the very least , in my view , and I think the plaintiffs might agree with this , the reporters would have to testify .",testimony
23426,"I did n't say this strictly in the opinion , perhaps , but my opinion was not meant to allow the testimony of the reporters to go in any way , in particular , outside the four corners of the affidavits rendered by the reporters .",testimony:go
23427,"I ca n't say that to the word , and that 's why the opinions were crafted the way that they were .",craft
23428,The Court has to have some discretion on the questioning .,
23429,"But I was as clear as I could possibly be that what is at issue here would be , for example , the particular events that the reporters wrote about and questions such as -- simple questions , did they attend the meeting , did they hear them say the comments , did they write the story immediately after , did they take notes at the time of the meeting .",web_writing:attendance:web_writing
23430,"I thought my opinion was clear in that regard , and as you appropriately characterize , no questions as to bias or motivation or reasons to misrepresent quotes would be allowed in .",characterization
23431,"I did not view and do not view the law as providing that there is some exhaustion requirement , although I understand some cases have said that .",amenity
23432,"In this particular fact situation -- and I do think , I will say , on the issue of precedent , you can distinguish cases of -- and I 'm not so sure I would be as fearful as some might be as to precedential value .",differentiation
23433,"I think this case is somewhat distinguishable , and I do n't know that a judge in another situation would knee-jerk allow this type of testimony .",testimony
23434,"We are in a very unique situation here , and that 's what we have .",
23435,"Finally , the last thing that I want to do - I 'm answering soliloquy with soliloquy here .",
23436,I 'm not sure if this is a dialogue .,dialogue
23437,"Finally , I am acutely cognizant of the fact that this trial has abundant media coverage , and it is surely not my intent to force a constitutional confrontation with two reporters and to create a side show that we do n't need to .",artistic_creation
23438,That 's why we 're meeting in chambers .,convention
23439,"But I 'll tell you that if it 's their persistent position that they do n't want to testify , then we 'll go on the record -- now , I 'm not going to put them on the witness stand .",testimony
23440,I do n't think it 's necessary to do that .,
23441,"I would bring you and the reporters , I will tell you , to the bar .",
23442,"I will swear them in , I will have them sworn in .",
23443,I will ask you the question whether they 're going to testify .,testimony
23444,"I will allow them to speak for themselves on that point , and then we 'll decide what we 're going to do at that point .",public_speaking
23445,"I do n't know what else to do , but I 'm not going to go through the charade of having them take the stand and assert , you know , as articulately as they can the privilege that they believe that they can avail themselves of .",go:assertion
23446,"I interrupted you , but I think it was necessary to do that .",interruption
23447,"Well , let me share with you why I have the issue that I have .",sharing
23448,"About a week and a half ago I had a telephone dialogue with Eric because I had proposed to Eric the possibility that in light of your most current order and because you took out the issues of biases and things of that nature and because we 're going to be called to trial by Eric , that maybe he should be speaking to Pat to see whether they would be willing to accept the affidavit in lieu of the testimony .",proposal:bias:public_speaking:acceptance:public_speaking
23449,I think we 're beyond that .,
23450,"Well , and then what happened was , we had a conference call , Eric , Pat , several others in Pat 's office and myself and Terry .",affectation
23451,They indicated that they would not .,
23452,"And then in the course of that conversation , the defendants counsel had stated , for example , we would like the opportunity to ask if they heard Mr. So and So say something , why did n't they write that .",writing
23453,That 's what I 'm concerned about with respect to --,
23454,I 'm not going to allow that question .,
23455,"But you were n't at the deposition , meaning you do n't know that that question would n't be allowed and quite frankly yesterday you were in trial .",
23456,"I said , though , very clearly in the last order , I thought , in the September 12th order , that I would be available .",
23457,"And I thought , when I heard that the reporters , quite frankly , appeared for depositions , that when I was on a break , I was going to hear an accumulated list of questions that were objected to and that I would have to rule on those questions .",objection
23458,"Now , I do n't have time to preside over a deposition at this late date .",
23459,And I know that you respect that .,adhesive_bonding
23460,You 're experienced counsel and you know that .,
23461,I do know from my private practice experience that I was extremely loathed to get a judge on the telephone in mid-deposition .,
23462,That could be one of the most unhappy experiences that a lawyer would have .,experience
23463,Depending on the time of day and the personality of the judge .,
23464,"Especially after your last opinion on my case , I do n't want to call you at all .",
23465,"As you see , I 'm far more genial than I express in writing .",proofreading
23466,"What I invited by that opinion , though , was that I would be available -- and I believe in an issue that is as important to the reporters and to you , as their counsel , as this , it is appropriate for you to stop a deposition on a question like that , instruct your witness not to answer , and allow the Court to rule on it .",dissolution:counseling:norm
23467,I was inviting you to do that .,
23468,"Now , I understand what your reasons are for not doing that , and I think you can do that .",
23469,"Now , if you 're telling me that you have problems with certain anticipated questions but not others and if you 're telling me that the reporters would not exercise the privilege if they were kept roughly within the confines of their affidavits --",
23470,I go beyond that .,
23471,I 'm willing to have them testify as to what they wrote in the article and basically forget the affidavit .,testimony:writing_style
23472,That means everything that 's set forth in that article .,
23473,"Well , then I think we 've clarified that point .",elaboration
23474,Then I think you should reschedule the depositions and try to do that .,
23475,"Well , if I can interject -- I mean , this is kind of like my last hurrah .",
23476,We could only hope not .,
23477,It depends what happens next week .,social_influence
23478,"Because we do n't have an order with respect to trial testimony -- and we do n't , except for the fact that , again , they 're naked .",testimony
23479,"I 'll produce that order , if necessary .",production_process
23480,"Well , let me share with you where I 'm coming from , because I think what I 've done here -- and obviously I ca n't do your job .",sharing:come
23481,"But what I 'm proposing here , if you could just evaluate it .",proposal:evaluation
23482,"Depending how long this trial goes , you might be my guest in terms of doing my job .",trial
23483,All I 'm doing is adding something to what it is that you basically have already written .,addition:writing_style
23484,And if I could just read this .,reading
23485,You have no idea how long it took us to write this .,web_writing
23486,Because I think it does exactly what you just said .,
23487,"It says , Wherein an affidavit is provided in lieu of testimony to support a newspaper article or newspaper articles , the reporter shall be obligated to testify as to the facts set forth in the articles , i.e. , what was seen and heard as related in the newspaper articles .",amenity:testimony:support:prestation:testimony
23488,"By doing so , the reporters would be verbalizing the contents of said affidavit -- I think , actually , they were your words when we had the telephone conference -- by testifying as to what appears in the newspaper article or articles , unless such affidavit is otherwise accepted by all parties as validating and authenticating the contents of the newspaper article or articles in issue .",testimony:acceptance:acknowledgment
23489,"Meaning if they accept it , it becomes moot .",acceptance
23490,"However , no testimony shall relate to unpublished material or information or to the reporters ' motivations , bias , mental impressions , or other information extrinsic to what the reporter saw and heard , and the reporter shall not be obligated to reveal any confidential sources .",testimony:intimate_relationship:prestation
23491,"What I 've tried to do here is to say , they 'll testify as to everything that appeared in those articles .",testimony
23492,"And how I then distinguish this case from maybe my next case is , where an affidavit is provided and the Court or the parties do n't accept the affidavit .",distinction:amenity:acceptance
23493,"What I 've done is , it says that there 's no extraneous unpublished material questioning .",
23494,That 's the clarity that I need .,
23495,"And then , quite frankly , my mindset is , if the issue of the defendants is that we were biased in our reporting because we either misquoted somebody or whatever , well , this is n't a jury trial .",reporting:scoop
23496,You 're trying this case .,appeal
23497,"You 're either going to believe the reporters or you 're going to believe Mr. Buckingham or Mr. Bonsell or whomever when they say , I did n't say that .",
23498,But my concern is that I have to have some degree of certainty by your order that they ca n't ask any questions as to unpublished materials .,
23499,Are you suggesting that this language should apply to both the depositions and the trial testimony ?,suggestion:technoscience
23500,"Meaning if you could adapt language similar to this for the trial testimony and I agree , I have no problem in them being at a deposition prior to trial with the same kind of language relative to that .",literary_adaptation:testimony:literary_adaptation
23501,I will appear at a deposition prior to trial .,precedence
23502,"I would like to do that , because of my own health conditions , maybe on Friday in terms as to a deposition , if that works within anybody 's schedule , and then maybe the latter part of next week .",
23503,"Because what I did was , I put my surgery off until next Friday to get this done .",surgical_procedure
23504,"Well , the problem Friday , I assume you fellows are getting out of here on Friday , but I 'm not sure of that .",
23505,Or we could do it Monday .,
23506,"I mean , whatever works .",
23507,"Well , we do have Friday morning off .",
23508,Although you may have something scheduled in terms of pretrial planning .,scheduling:postponement
23509,I have a plane flight .,flight
23510,I was not going to be here .,
23511,Do we need the whole team ?,
23512,I was the one going to take the deposition .,deposition
23513,"Yeah , Ed was there yesterday .",
23514,"Well , we 'll do what we have to do .",
23515,"Scheduling usually is n't my pay grade , but , you know , you can figure that out .",mathematical_problem
23516,"Judge , if I may , there are some things here that we can agree with , but there are others that we ca n't .",
23517,"And this is why , in our opinion , Judge .",
23518,"You know , if our clients are believed , the reporters did talk to them but took misrepresentative statements so that they left things out to put them in a false light and in so doing have created articles that , if they were admitted for the truth of the matter asserted , would be misrepresentative .",artistic_creation:falsification:assertion
23519,"Well , that 's what I 'm not going to get into .",
23520,And I understand and I respect that argument .,adhesive_bonding
23521,And I understood that argument before .,
23522,And what I do n't want to do here is turn this into an oral argument on things that I 've already decided .,
23523,And I know you respect that .,adhesive_bonding
23524,"I think there is a privilege here , and I think the privilege sometimes gets drawn in what appears to be an ad hoc manner .",adduction
23525,But my job is to find where to put the line down in this case .,discovery
23526,To traipse into the area of why they selectively used a quote as opposed to not using other things that were said I think is to get on a very slippery slope .,use:objection:use
23527,"It really almost precipitates a bias line of questioning , and I 'm not going to allow it .",
23528,I am trying to narrowly draw this .,
23529,"I understand that that 's not what the defendants want in this case , but I do n't think it 's called for .",
23530,"And , as a matter of fact , I think if I did that and I ordered that and if -- I assume that the reporters would not testify and I would predict , if it went to the Third Circuit on that basis , I would be reversed .",order:testimony:prediction:inference:reversible_process

24182,"Well , in numerous ways .",
24183,"First , as a teacher , professionally , I feel that teachers in general are harmed , myself , as well , because there 's a dichotomy here in what they 're saying about this statement that they have passed on intelligent design as they 're not teaching it .",teaching_methodology
24184,"On the other hand , they 've said that it enhances state standards and critical thinking .",
24185,"In my mind , everything that you do in a classroom is teaching .",teaching_methodology

24189,The statements I make or the statements that I do not make in my classroom tell my students something .,

24211,Your oldest child is 14 years old .,
24212,And your child 's name is Alix ?,
24213,And Alix is presently in the ninth-grade biology class at Dover High School ?,
24214,And my understanding from your husband 's testimony yesterday is that she has n't yet reached the section in biology that deals with evolution .,testimony:evolution

24219,"Now , you testified about two -- or several meetings , but two meetings in particular I want to ask you some questions about .",testimony
24220,And those are the meetings that occurred on June 7th of 2004 and then the meeting on June 14th of 2004 .,
24221,I believe you described these meetings as involving some heated exchanges between some board members and the public .,description:involvement
24222,And it 's my sense from your testimony that the majority of the statements that you appear to find objectionable were statements made by Mr. Buckingham ?,testimony:objection
24223,There were statements made by many of the school board members that I found objectionable .,
24224,It 's just that Mr. Buckingham always seemed to say very inappropriate things .,
24225,"But in addition , Alan Bonsell said very inappropriate things , and Noel Weinrich said very inappropriate things .",
24226,"It 's just that I did n't give much credit to Noel Weinrich 's comments because he would say things like , Darwin 's at least what 60 , years old , a theory becomes a theory if you say it over and over again .",comment
24227,Those are the kind of things he would say .,
24228,But they were all very outspoken .,
24229,"Now , the controversy on the June 7th and June 14th meeting was surrounding the selection of a biology textbook .",choice
24230,June 7th and June 14th ?,
24231,"And the biology textbook that was in question at the time , I believe it was the version of the Miller - Levine biology book .",
24232,Is that your understanding ?,
24233,It very well could be .,
24234,I 'm not sure what the edition in debate was .,discussion
24235,But the statements that you testified to and the controversy that you were describing was surrounding the purchase or selection of that particular biology book for the school district .,testimony:documentation:purchasing:biological_selection
24236,"Yes , it was definitely the Miller - Levine textbook .",
24237,"I do n't know what the edition was or the copyright date or any of that information , but I do know that it was that biology textbook that was being debated very rigorously .",competitive_debate
24238,"And , in fact , the school district purchased the Miller - Levine biology book to be used as the primary text for the ninth-grade biology class .",purchasing:use
24239,And that would be the textbook that your daughter Alix will be using ?,use
24240,"Yes , with the dragonfly on it .",
24241,She already has the book ?,

24243,Have you looked through it ?,
24244,Have I looked through the book ?,
24245,"Yes , I have looked through the book .",
24246,Do you have any objections with the book ?,objection
24247,"No , I do n't .",
24248,"She was n't given a copy of Pandas and People , was she ?",
24249,"No , she was not .",
24250,So the only required textbook for that class was that biology book that was creating all the controversy on June 7th and June 14th .,artistic_creation
24251,"To my knowledge , the only required book is that book , in addition to supplemental materials that the instructor has .",
24252,"Now , you made a comment in your direct testimony that intelligent design conflicts with your brand of religion .",comment:testimony:organizational_conflict
24253,Is intelligent design another brand of religion ?,
24254,"What I 'm saying is that I believe intelligent design , as well as the ideas of creationism , in particular , the Young Earth creationists , which , I 'm sorry , I do n't agree with .",
24255,"do n't agree with the age of , you know , the earth and their opinion .",
24256,There are things that I do not believe .,
24257,And I do not believe the same things as the board members who adopted that statement .,adoption
24258,And so your understanding is intelligent design is the same as Young Earth creationism ?,
24259,"Well , to my understanding , intelligent design just presupposes that everything in life is too complex , that it has to be designed .",interior_design
24260,"But I also know that creationism was used repeatedly with the term - or , I 'm sorry , not with the term "" intelligent design . """,use

24271,I want to explore your understanding of what has actually taken place in this ninth-grade biology class that your daughter Alix is presently taking .,exploration
24272,Is it your understanding that Darwin 's theory of evolution will be taught in this class pursuant to the Pennsylvania academic standards ?,teaching_methodology
24273,"And as far as I know , that is the case , because Dover says that it is a standards - based school , and so I assume that when they say that and they say that students have to pass certain material before they can be advanced into new material , that they would have to be abiding by the state standards .",elevation
24274,And I take it from your answer you have no objection to that ?,objection
24275,"To following state standards , no , I have no objection .",accompaniment:objection
24276,And so it 's your understanding that the Pennsylvania state standards require students to learn about Darwin 's theory of evolution and eventually take a standardized test of which that theory is a part of it ?,evolution:test
24277,"Yes , the PSSA test , yes .",testing
24278,And you have no objection to that ?,objection

24281,I would hope that they would provide lots of academic information on those tests .,amenity:amenity

24300,Has Dr. Miller left the courtroom ?,farewell
