1400,Is that for real ? /,
1401,That 's for real ! /,
1402,That really happened ! /,announcement
1403,"And one time I can remember , I think it was Steve , my brother , um , /",
1404,"he , -",
1405,"and they would give treats like candy , /",
1406,I do n't even remember what all kinds of prizes they would give . /,
1407,"But for some reason , and I think this is really true , he got ice cream sandwiches ! /",
1408,Like a box of ice cream sandwiches . /,
1409,And of course there 's nothing to do with a box of ice cream sandwiches when you 're at a 2 - hour movie ! /,
1410,They 're going to melt ! /,dissolution
1411,"And another , um , -",
1412,"<disfluency> that was in , </disfluency> that was in High Point , NC. /",
1413,And then we moved to Charlotte /,relative_motion
1414,and we used to go to -- and I do n't think it 's even still there I do n't know if the building is or not -- but the Dilworth Theatre . /,
1415,"I lived in the Dilworth area , /",
1416,and we would go to the Dilworth Theatre /,
1417,and I do remember that it cost 9 cents to get a ticket to get in . /,
1418,"And we <disfluency> would </disfluency> , could go to the movie . /",
1419,"We would get maybe 15 cents each to go to the movie , /",
1420,and I sound like I 'm 95 years old -- with those kinds of prices . /,
1421,"Um , but we would go to the movie /",
1422,"and then you would go in and get <disfluency> your </disfluency> , your snack that you wanted . /",
1423,And there were several different choices . /,
1424,I do n't ever remember getting popcorn at the movie until I was a teenager or in my adult life . /,
1425,"But we would , uh , buy , -",buy
1426,"lollipops is what they call them now , /",
1427,but we called them suckers /,
1428,and we would get often a 2 - cent sucker . /,
1429,Are you making fun ? /,
1430,"No , I love this story . /",love
1431,And the 2 - cent suckers is what is referred to now as a Tootsie Roll Pop . /,
1432,And we called them 2 - cent suckers because every other sucker cost a penny . /,
1433,Except these were 2 cents because they had the Tootsie Roll in the middle . /,
1434,And there was one other sucker that cost a nickel /,
1435,"and we called that an all day sucker , just because you could n't eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long . /",eating
1436,"And one other form of refreshment that we got , which really embarrassed my mother because she did n't know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one Saturday , -",
1437,there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre . /,
1438,And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this ; /,
1439,all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this . /,
1440,We would go into the bakery /,
1441,and we would ask for -- a nickel worth of scraps ! /,
1442,And we did n't even have to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew to have all this ready for all the kids going to the movie . /,
1443,"And what it was it was broken cookies and broken pieces of whatever happened while they were baking , mistakes . /",disrepair:error:baking
1444,So they would fill little bags for us /,filling
1445,and we would give them a nickel /,
1446,and we could take that to the movie theatre with us . /,
1447,And that 's all the stories I can remember about the movies right now . /,
1448,I do know that I did used to go the movie downtown at the Carolina Theatre . /,
1449,"And when I was young , it was n't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie . /",
1450,"I mean , my mother knew where we were going /",
1451,"and she knew when we would get back , /",
1452,but today you would n't send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother ; /,
1453,you just would n't do it . /,
1454,And we could skate to the movie or ride a bicycle to the movie /,figure_skating:trail_riding
1455,and we would do that . Which is kind of sad that you ca n't do that anymore /,
1456,"and it 's not just because <disfluency> things are </disfluency> , there 're bad people in the world but it 's too much traffic . /",
1457,"You have to check everything about a movie , check it out to see what the content is /",
1458,and just was n't like that when I was growing up . /,
1459,"Also about that same time period in my life , I guess again between seven and ten years old , which seems to be what I remember most vividly , my best friend uh , was Kathy Josey , /",guessing_game
1460,"and she was a next door neighbor also , /",
1461,"and we remained friends up until , uh , she was about 35 /",
1462,and she passed away with cancer . /,
1463,"But <disfluency> we </disfluency> , we remained close friends . /",
1464,"In fact we shared an apartment , first apartment either one of us ever had . /",sharing
1465,"And when we were , um , little girls we used to play "" Career Girls "" ! /",role-playing
1466,We did ! /,
1467,And we used to try to dress up and pretend we were businesswomen . /,
1468,And we would go to work and pretend we had an apartment together /,
1469,"and then when we grew up , we sure did ; /",
1470,we got an apartment . /,
1471,"Um , Kathy and I also used to play other kind of dress ups /",duet
1472,"and <disfluency> it just </disfluency> , <disfluency> it seems like </disfluency> , I remember we both had like our mother 's long skirts , /",
1473,or the skirts would be long on us /,
1474,and we would literally wear dress up clothes that belonged to our mothers . /,wears
1475,"But <disfluency> we had </disfluency> , Kathy had one pair of pearls or beads of some sort of necklace that was her mother 's /",
1476,and I did n't have the necklace . /,
1477,And it was really beautiful /,
1478,"and I really , really wanted one . /",
1479,So we only had the one necklace /,
1480,"and <disfluency> we </disfluency> , er , we decided , -",
1481,"I do n't know if it was jointly or if Kathy was just extremely nice or whatever , /",
1482,but she said I could wear it part of the time . /,wears
1483,And we would literally time the amount of time we wore it like 30 minutes or 15 minutes or whatever . /,wears
1484,"And the way we decided who got to wear it first , -",wears
1485,"and this always kind of bothered me because I know Kathy did this intentionally , /",
1486,she said the youngest one got to wear it first /,wears
1487,and she was like six months younger than I am . /,
1488,"So , <disfluency> it </disfluency> , that became a normal thing with us . /",
1489,"Whenever we only had one of something she would always say , "" Well , I think the youngest one gets to do it , or wear it or whatever first . "" /",wears
1490,"And , that just always stuck in my mind , that <disfluency> in </disfluency> , in our adult life I brought that up to her /",adhesion
1491,and she sort of acted like she did n't know anything about that /,acting
1492,"and I thought to myself , "" she does , "" /",
1493,and then she laughed about it /,
1494,and she realized that she had kinda held a trump card on that one . /,code
1495,"Um , also we did a lot of pretending /",
1496,and as I said we played career girls and the dress ups . /,role-playing
1497,And my sister and I used to pretend also /,
1498,"and Jill is about 2 years younger than I am , maybe two and a half , /",
1499,"and we used to play Robin Hood except we did n't have a Maid Marion , /",role-playing
1500,"we had a Saretha , /",
1501,I do n't know where in the world that name came from . /,
1502,"But we would switch playing Robin Hood , /",role-playing
1503,one would play Robin Hood /,role-playing
1504,and one would play Saretha . /,role-playing
1505,"And Saretha was the counter , /",
1506,"would be the same thing as Maid Marion , /",
1507,"and , <disfluency> why </disfluency> , again , I do n't know why we did n't use Maid Marion . /",use
1508,"But in my mind I can remember playing that , like all day long . /",role-playing
1509,And we would go over to my grandparents ' /,
1510,"and they had <disfluency> a </disfluency> a big white house with a big front porch and , uh , banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch . /",
1511,And it was just a great place to pretend /,
1512,and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters /,climbing
1513,and we could make those our horses /,animalisation
1514,"or , uh , it could be a castle ; /",
1515,just do many things with it . /,
1516,"Um , and when we were still living in High Point in our back yard we had a huge , -",
1517,"I do n't know , /",
1518,"I guess it was an oak tree , /",guessing_game
1519,"but it was a really big tree , /",
1520,but it was a climbable tree . /,
1521,"And it had real large , thick branches extending out to the side /",building_expansion
1522,and they were fat enough branches where as a child of eight and nine years old we could straddle the branches . /,
1523,And that was another game that Jill and I used to play ; /,duet
1524,we would pretend we were in the jungle /,
1525,and we would climb up on the tree /,ascent
1526,and we would straddle the tree branches and pretend it was our elephant . /,
1527,"And in the yard , we had an old tree that had been cut down /",machining
1528,and just the stump was remaining /,
1529,"and my mother had planted , um , flowers all around that stump /",planting
1530,"and we would use that stump <disfluency> as a </disfluency> , as a throne /",use
1531,and the princess got to sit up on that stump on that throne and have all those flowers around her /,
1532,and that would be the throne /,
1533,and she would be the queen or the princess or whatever . /,
1534,"When I was a teenager , an Audrey Hepburn movie came out called Wait Until Dark . /",
1535,And I think I was probably 16 or 17 years old ; /,
1536,we were of driving age . /,
1537,And I had a group of girlfriends that I ran around with /,running

1539,"Everybody had their own "" best "" friend /",
1540,but then we had one big group that we used to do a lot of things together . /,
1541,"Um , and we <disfluency> would </disfluency> , had that many girls /",
1542,but we would only go out in a couple of cars /,
1543,"and I remember one of the girls , Betty Belle , /",
1544,"her dad had a VW Beetle , /",

1553,"and we did n't have chain pizza places like we do now , like Pizza Hut and all that . /",
1554,This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go . /,

1557,and we would order one pizza and all share it /,order:sharing

1559,and I think we would make the waitresses mad because we did n't have money to leave tips . /,
1560,We would also drink water . /,drinking
1561,"So it was n't a good situation for the waitresses , /",
